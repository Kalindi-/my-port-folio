This is my project 1 for Udacity's fend.

---

It is hosted on google app engine, the page can be found here: http://my-little-port-folio.appspot.com/1

The python file renders the content for the page.

The css is not directly connected, thus clicking on the html file will display only html in the browser.

To work with the connected code one could run it locally on the desctop google app engine, or save-page-as from the online link (and the css too), and then use those files.

A review said I could try srcsets out, so I tried a bit, but I assume failed a bit also.
It can be found here: http://my-little-port-folio.appspot.com/2
As I enlarge or make the page smaller only the picture element responds, all others dont change neither based on the viewport neither on width. I asked about it in the forum, and got a "working example".
I provided the code. It didn't really really work for me to figure out the mistakes, some things didnt work in the example itself, some i didn't manage.
One difference I found is that in the viewport settings my images do not have the same size as the size provided.

If you have any tips about it I d be happy!

Thank you!
