This is my project 1 for Udacity's fend.

---

It is hosted on google app engine, the page can be found here: http://my-little-port-folio.appspot.com/

The python file renders the content for the page.

The css is not directly connected, thus clicking on the html file will display only html in the browser.

To work with the code one could run it locally on the desctop google app engine, or save-page-as from the online link (and the css too), and then use those files.
